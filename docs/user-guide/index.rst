Python consumers of data and service discovery information should use the Repertoire client, `rubin.repertoire`.
This library is available from PyPI and can be declared as a dependency or installed with pip in the normal way:

.. prompt:: bash

   pip install rubin-repertoire

Consumers in other languages, such as JavaScript, can use the Repertoire server API directly.
