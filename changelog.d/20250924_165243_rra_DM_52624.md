### Backwards-incompatible changes

- Include InfluxDB connection information other than authentication credentials in the main discovery response rather than only a URL to the authenticated route. Put the URL to the authenticated route in a new `credentials_url` key.
- Add new client method `influxdb_connection_info` that returns only public connection information. Add new client method `influxdb_credentials` that requires a token argument and returns the full connection information including credentials.
