### New features

- Add new client method `build_nublado_dict`, which returns a stripped-down version of service discovery information in dictionary form suitable for JSON encoding. This will be used for service discovery inside [Nublado](https://nublado.lsst.io/) containers. The format is designed to maximize the chance it will continue working with old software stacks.
