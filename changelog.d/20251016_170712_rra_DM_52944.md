- Move all data services in the discovery results model under datasets in a new per-dataset `services` key and eliminate the `data` key under the `services` top-level key.
- Move the HiPS list URL for a dataset into a new `hips` service under `services`, instead of a separate `hips_list` key directly under the dataset.
