### Backwards-incompatible changes

- Rename the `urls` field of discovery information to `services`.
- Convert the values of the `data`, `internal`, and `ui` mappings to be full objects, moving the URL into the `url` field of that object. This creates room for additional fields in the future.

### New features

- Add an optional `openapi` key to service information for data and internal services, which contains a URL for the OpenAPI JSON schema if set. Add support for that field to the corresponding service generation rules.
