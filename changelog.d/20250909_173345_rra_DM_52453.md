### Backwards-incompatible changes

- Rename `RepertoireBuilder.build` to `RepertoireBuilder.build_discovery` now that there are multiple types of information that the builder can build.

### New features

- Add `RepertoireBuilder.build_influxdb` to construct InfluxDB discovery information, and a new class, `RepertoireBuilderWithSecrets`, with method `build_influxdb_with_credentials`, to build InfluxDB discovery information including credentials.
- Add a new route, `/discovery/influxdb/{database}`, that returns InfluxDB discovery information with credentials. This route will be protected by Gafaelfawr authentication.
- Add corresponding models and client methods `influxdb_databases` and `get_influxdb_connection_info` to retrieve the new information.
