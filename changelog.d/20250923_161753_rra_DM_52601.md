### Backward-incompatible changes

- Add a `DiscoveryClient.aclose` method to cleanly shut down the internal HTTPX async client if one was not passed into the constructor. Users of the Repertoire client who do not use the FastAPI dependency and do not provide an HTTPX client to the `DiscoveryClient` constructor should call this method when they are done using the client.
