### New features

- Add HiPS to the Repertoire configuration and use it to generate HiPS list URLs for every dataset with associated HiPS discovery information.
- Add support for generating a per-dataset HiPS list file on a separately-configurable route from the main Repertoire path prefix. The list file is assembled from HiPS properties files retrieved via HTTP, authenticated by a Gafaelfawr token.
- Add support for generating a separate HiPS list file for a single dataset on a legacy route.
