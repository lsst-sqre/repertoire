### New features

- Add optional API versions to the configuration for data and internal services and include API versions in the discovery information. Each API version, if configured, is a mapping to an object containing the URL and the optional IVOA standardID.
- Add new client methods `versions_for_data` and `versions_for_internal` that list the available versions for data and internal services.
- Add an optional `version` argument to client methods `url_for_data` and `url_for_internal` to get the URL of a specific API version instead of the default URL.
